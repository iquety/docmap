# Using replacement tags

## Inserting tags for dynamic menus

As already explained, Docmap is a markdown file interpreter, which looks for special tags to replace them with corresponding content.

Inside a markdown file, just put one or several tags so that the tool can identify and replace.

Tags are lowercase words that begin and end with two dashes "--". The following is the list of available tags:

Tag | Description
-- | --
page-nav | Draw a navigation menu to go forward, back or go to the documentation index
summary | Draws an index, containing links to all documentation pages
summary-nav | Draws a special navigation menu for the page containing the table of contents. Unlike "page-nav", this navigation has a link to the project's "readme.md" file.
